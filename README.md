# CPU Scheduling Simulator: Round-Robin Algorithm

## Overview
This project simulates CPU scheduling using the Round-Robin algorithm, implemented using **Bash and Python**. It generates random CPU tasks, schedules them using a time quantum, and computes **Waiting Time (WT)** and **Turnaround Time (TAT)** for each task.

## Features
Task Generation: Randomized burst times and arrival times  
Round-Robin Scheduling: Ensures fair CPU time for all tasks  
Performance Metrics: Computes Waiting Time and Turnaround Time
CSV File Handling: Reads/Writes scheduling data in `tasks.csv`
